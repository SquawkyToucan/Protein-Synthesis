# Protein-Synthesis
Translates codons into proteins through typing in bases A, T, C, and G

All this does is takes a set of three bases (say "AAA") and puts out a protein (like "Lysine").

Run the jar if you want to test it out, you should wait a second after the pop-up or it won't work for some reason
